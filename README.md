Minor improvments have been made during projects in 2012-2015 in a kind-of 1.2-release candidate.

As of 2017-06, I am starting the transfer of 1.1-release and 1.2-devel branches to GitHub to facilitate a peer review for 1.2-release and to give the project a new home.

No files have been moved yet, but they are soon to come!
